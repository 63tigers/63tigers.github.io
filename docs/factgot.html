          <p>why. why any of this? well, simply, because i can.</p>
          <p>i officially started webdev when i got my first toyhou.se account (now deleted) in October of 2022.  the idea of building my own designs for my characters bios sounded awesome and i adored how customizable and versatile toyhou.se was to me (though looking back ive just realized how messy and unoptomized toyhou.se is LOL. but so is my code). toyhou.se is built with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap 5</a> so that was the framework i began learning with. sure it isnt great but it definitely is a good start to making my own code. </p>
          <p>i came across a carrd (rip terror.crd.co) looking for graphics (i lied i wasnt looking for graphics LOL. i just started typing random words with .crd.co). thats when i learned about neocities. neocities was a place where people could do anything... on a website... for free. now, at this point i was addicted to going through the special sauce page just admiring peoples websites and being like "wowwww i could do this in toyhou.se". after a while i realized that toyhou.se was preeeety limiting (limits being no custom cursors or access to stylesheets with let you modify animations and fonts and stuff) so i thought about ditching it for neocities. </p>
          <p>i ended up ditching it (temporarily) for neocities.</p>
          <p>█████████ was born in january 2023. after opening the neocities blank code editor i realized that i had been so spoiled by bootstrap doing all of the customizing for me that i didnt know what i was doing.  it wasnt that i unfamilliar with html, but i had never had to use a css file a day in my life. i closed the neocities blank code editor and looked up how to change border colors. cool. how do i change the text color? <code>color:color;</code>ecetera. with the entire first iteration of █████████, i looked shit up. thats it. i decided that my website looked like shit so for the first time ever, i opened up <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>. THE HOLY BIBLE. yeah that was the answer to everything. my code was still shit. anyways</p>
          <p>█████████ died in likeeeeee March of 2024? i got bored and my code sucked so i gave up for a while. even so, i practiced more and started looking at advanced css (of which i still dont apply to my work) and javascript docs. so i got gud.</p>
          <p>I decided that i didnt like how neocities had like this "social media" aspect to it so i left and went to github, but that didn't last long. for starters, github commits take a second to process onto a repository, so that kinda pissed me off- but it was my own mistake to not use vscode or notepad or whatever to code my website instead of just using the github editor LOL. also the github interface was really advanced? even after using github for like a year now i still dont know what im doing. i also made the mistake of a purchasing a domain for my github site. i never ended up using it. sad! rip  ██████.fun. thankfully it was 99 cents. thanks hostinger. i went back to neocities because i hated github (for repositories) more</p>
          <p>May 2024. Pentumbra was conceived. July 2024. Pentumbra was born. I'm overall pretty good at web dev. it was at this point i thought "this is the end all be all". pentumbra was designed to be a place where i made everything myself, except for the fonts and occasional javascript, and make it an artsy fartsy website. and it was that for like, 4 months. see <a href="https://archive.org/">the internet archive</a> (https://pentumbra.neocities.org). </p>
          <p>pentumbra was everything i wanted and more up until December. God. december was awful. I was finalizing my index version two when i saw. i kid you not. in my cbox i saw a dude named quackity. I got raided by my now ex friends friends because he decided to ditch them and i guess link them to my website? why i knew what happened is because that friend actually im gonna name drop. fuck you conrad. connor used a false face with these friends. i gotta start from the beginning. wait no id be doxxing myself</p>
          <!--
                    <p>basically me and connor used to troll in among us discord servers up until i got bored. but then in 2023 he met some fuckers (21+, mind you, some old enough to be my parents), and he joined their server. he lied about... honestly nothing? i think? he was 30, cat guy, a total faggot. anyways he'd rat the information that server to another server who hated that server and it was funny. he decided to take it up a notch and make himself more legit by using a face that wasnt his. surprise. that face was quackity. i chose quackity because it was funny! hed post quackitys photos into their selfies channel and they thought it was fr it was so funny. also he got divorced in jan 2024 so he dipped for a while.totally his fault btw. connor is manipulative as fuck. rip? anywasy he came back in june and they had a minecraft server so he trolled in there for a while. he stole their shit and then blamed it on this guy named casper who he described as "incompetent" and "whiny". bitch how are you more competent than him?? i think half of the time when connor stole shit he didnt even need it. he just did it to be petty. after that i stopped trolling with him and he did everything on his own. me and connor stopped talking for a while because i was finishing finals and we started back in october. apparently he had got his roommate roped into this too? im not name dropping her she never did anything, really. she just did whatever he told her to. also casper is allegedyly gone and he continued the stealing in minecraft lolllll is he fucking stupid? anywaaaaays december hits. im not saying what happened but shit hit the fan for connor and he officially decided he needed to leave the server. just a day after he left the server everyone found out he used a false face. he was like "shit i dodged a bullet" and i was like "stfu you were supposed to stop last october". and then i fucked up and they found my website. so me and connor shared an account on roblox because he bought me 100 dollars worth of robux (which i blew playing doors) and i was like hells yes! HE HAD MY WEBSITE IN MY BIO, TRYING TO PROMOTE IT. THE FUCK. soo that meant that theyknew my website. i got harassed on my guestbook, cbox, and neopets account? i shouldve accepted her friend request. but at this point i was just sick of it. me and connor went back and forth and we arent friends anymore. i had to beg him to tell them to stop harassing me because they thought we were the same person. anyways. connor. go to hell! i dont know where he is now, probably working at his new job at the doctors office, pretending like he didn't hurt like 7 people including myself. grown ass man with a phd trolling with a (then) teenager online btw. im also in the wrong for what happened but he took it a new level.</p>
          
          -->
          <p>after that i grew disatisfied with my wbesite. i couldnt look at my new index page, the thing i had worked on for 3 weeks, because of that. i just wanted to give up. but then i met <a href="https://lopster.neocities.org/">lopster</a>, <a href="https://goooby.neocities.org/">goooby</a> and <a title="rip" href="https://lopster.neocities.org/pages/benny">sugarforbrains</a> so december was really dope near the end! so i chose not to delete my site then and there. pretty awesome right?</p>
          <p>i got bored of pentumbra in feburary and started making a new site, which is 63tigers. despite that, i still planned to keep pentumbra up as an archive. four days after i decide this, i deleted my images folder, so i cant leave it up anywhere but the internet archive. sad! rip pentumbra 3/1/25.</p>
          <p>erm. thats basically everything i wanted to cover. recently ive began to lose my interest in web development because I learned how to program, professionally, and i actually have somewhat of a social life now. despite this, i do want to keep 63tigers. but updates will be much slower as i work on things that interest me moer. i have to remember that this is my website, and i dont owe anyone anything, actually. if i dissapear for 3 weeks, then so be it. if i dissapear for 3 years (unlikely), then so be it. I want to work on this website, among other things, at my own pace. that's why i began to hate pentumbra, is because i began promising updates. thats not what i wanted my personal site to be about. ya. i dont owe anyone anything and promises are nonexistent to me anymore okay, poke? lame!</p>
