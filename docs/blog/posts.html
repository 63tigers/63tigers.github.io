            I want to consume more anime but I only ever watch stylized anime because its literally just the style that interests me. and its rare to find stylized anime. like studio ghibli mob psycho or pokemon or cowboy beepboop. or even hunterxhunter? I guess lucky star can be considered stylized but it's moe and that's a whole genre in itself. I don't know. I don't know. what if I killed you in the time loop<br>
            Im also really picky about anime. I want to watch alien 9 and yotsuba and finish lucky star but there is literally nothing about it that interests me. but uhhhh I didn't want to watch mob psycho and I ended up getting hyperfixated. I don't know.
