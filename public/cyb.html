    <br>
    <p>im a neet. despite this i am busy a lot! doing what, i cant tell ya. (playing yakuza) (drawing shit) (fawning over yaoi)</p>
    <p>speaking of pets, i have a parakeet named canary and a black cat named bean as of current! yes, they are always separated. yes, our bird is very confused.</p>
    <p>"you didnt mention pets?" yeah sure man whatever</p>
    <p>i like making lists a lot. i think that just might be my autism thing. you can scroll down or click <a href="#shit">this</a> to see all of the things that interest me, okay?</p>
    <p>ive been coding since 2023 when i got my first (now deleted, just kidding, but no one can follow me) toyhouse account in october of that year. ever since ive been coding. my interest in coding turned into me being more interested in programming as of recent so thats why this site will not be heavily maintained like my older sites were.</p>
    <p>ive been drawing for 14 years. pretty cool. im still pretty bad at it, but thats because i have little interest in getting better at art now. its just not my main thing anymore! just kidding i still do anatomy studies because i hate myself. i think whenever i decide i want to go to college i might just take an art course simply because its like the one thing i can do with semi-confidence.</p>
    <p>gender? none. genderfucked. call me whatever you want. dont give a fuck. dont ask me if im straight or gay or in between because i dont know. im probably just achillean</p>
    <p>i can speak german. i know tiny bits of turkish. i can read cyrillic. i can speak french a little. i plan on learning japanese (not because im a weeb or anything but because im interested in culture). i dont know english. j'adore! wunderbar! merhaba!</p>
    <p>did you guys know that im not a weeb. yeah i think anime is pretty lame. whatever i watch its because i find it interesting, stylewise. im trying to venture out tho!</p>
    <p>i will talk about the entire black ops zombies storyline and games upon request PLEASE ASK ME I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVERRRR. literally my favorite thing ever. i know everything about it, at least the aether side. Another close second is Mouthwashing. and then mob psycho 100. ask <a href="https://lopster.neocities.org/">lopster</a> about mob psycho they know more than i do. did you know tjat i hate reigen</p>
